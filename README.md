# Iris_Prediction
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is commonly used for classification tasks. 
The dataset contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, 
with 50 flowers from each of three species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Project Description
The Iris dataset was a popular dataset for machine learning classification projects. It contained measurements for 150 iris 
flowers from three different species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica. My goal for the project was to create a classification
model that could accurately predict the species of a new iris flower based on its measurements. 
In this project, I used Python and its popular machine learning libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib,
to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling. 
The project will begin with loading and exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data. Then, we I processed the data 
by cleaning, transforming, and splitting it into training and testing sets. 
Next, I built several logistic regression classification model and evaluate model's performance using various metrics, 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Finally, I used it to predict the species of new iris flowers. I also visualized the results using Matplotlib and create a 
user-friendly interface using Flask to deploy the model.
